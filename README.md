# ChatRAD: Chat Robotic Animation Display

## Overview

**ChatRAD (Chat Robotic Animation Display)** is an innovative system that uses a swarm of robots to create animations based on input text. By combining generative AI and distributed coverage control laws, ChatRAD provides a unique and interactive way to visualize text-based animations.

## Features

- **Swarm Robotics:** Utilizes 3000 small mobile robots.
- **Generative AI:** Converts text input into dynamic animations.
- **Distributed Control Law:** Ensures precise and coordinated movement of robots.
- **Interactive Animations:** Responds in real-time to user input.

## How It Works

1. **Text Input:** Users provide input text for the desired animation.
2. **Generative AI Processing:** The system processes the input using advanced AI algorithms.
3. **Distributed Control:** A decentralized control method is applied to manage the movements of 3000 robots.
4. **Animation Display:** The robots move within a white field, each represented by a black box, to display the animation.

## Folder Structure

- `ChatRAD_outputs`: Contains the output results of the ChatRAD system.

    Each black box in the result represents a small mobile robot moving in the white field, showcasing the user-defined animation.

## Example

Here's an example of how the system translates input text into a visual animation:

**Input:** "Man, Sunglasses, ..."

**Output:**
